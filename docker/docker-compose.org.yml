# docker-compose.org.yml — Organisation deployment override (WSL + private registry)
#
# Extends the base docker-compose.yml for organisation deployment.
# Pulls the pre-built image from the private registry.
# The image must already have been built and pushed via scripts/build-org.sh.
#
# Pre-requisite:
#   ./scripts/build-org.sh [TAG]    # build & push from WSL
#
# Usage (inside WSL):
#   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml \
#                  -f docker/docker-compose.org.yml up -d
#
# Or via Makefile:
#   make org-up
#   make org-pull
